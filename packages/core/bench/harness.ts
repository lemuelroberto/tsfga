/**
 * The generator both equivalence harnesses run on.
 *
 * It exists because `breadth-equivalence.ts` and
 * `batch-equivalence.ts` carried two copies of it. Two copies that
 * must agree, with nothing enforcing agreement, is the same hazard
 * as a harness reporting clean over a path it never enters — which
 * is what happened here for a full round. Both files were twice
 * edited identically and checked afterwards with `diff` run by
 * hand; that is a habit, not a mechanism.
 *
 * The invariant: the seed sequence, and the order in which `rand()`
 * is drawn, are the contract. Every number both harnesses report is
 * a function of them. Nothing may reorder a draw, insert a draw, or
 * consume `rand` outside `buildStore`.
 *
 * The export policy: widen the list below when a third harness
 * actually needs a symbol, not before. `noUnusedLocals` is `false`
 * in `tsconfig.base.json`, so the compiler will never tell you an
 * export went dead — the list only grows unless someone keeps it
 * honest.

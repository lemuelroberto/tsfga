/**
 * `KyselyTupleStore` strips the instance's plugins, and Kysely
 * expresses a transaction as a `Kysely` subtype rather than as a
 * separate handle. So stripping plugins must not also strip the
 * transaction — if it did, `new KyselyTupleStore(trx)` would
 * silently write outside the caller's transaction, which no other
 * test in this package would catch: they all share one pooled
 * connection wrapped in a raw `BEGIN`.
 *
 * This file therefore owns its pool. Two connections is the
 * minimum that expresses the invariant — one held by the
 * transaction, one for the read that must not see into it — and no
 * more than that, because the runtime shims run test files as
 * separate processes and the server's connection slots are shared.

/**
 * The subject filter on `listSubjects`, exercised against real
 * stored rows rather than a mock.
 *
 * The gate runs in core, not in the adapter, and
 * `listDirectSubjects` has since left `TupleStore`, so this is the
 * only library path to those rows — and its whole coverage was one
 * mock-driven core suite. What the mock cannot show is that the
 * rows survive a round trip through PostgreSQL: the wildcard's
 * column pair — `subject_id` NULL beside `subject_wildcard` true,
 * which core spells `subjectId: "*"` — the nullable
 * `subject_relation`, and the condition name all have to come back
 * in the shape the filter compares.
 *
 * **Rows are pushed straight to the store.** `addTuple` refuses
 * exactly the rows under test, so a fixture built on the write path
 * could only ever contain admissible ones. Narrowing a relation
 * does not revalidate what is already stored, which is how a real
 * deployment reaches this state.
 *
 * Deliberately one-sided. tsfga's `listSubjects` returns direct
 * subjects with no expansion at all, while OpenFGA's `ListUsers`
 * expands usersets and computed relations; comparing the two would
 * fail by design, so there is no upstream binding for it.

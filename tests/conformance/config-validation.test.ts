/**
 * Shapes OpenFGA's typesystem rejects when it validates a model,
 * and the one tuple it rejects as implicit.
 *
 * Two of them changed an answer rather than merely widening the
 * write surface: a single-operand `intersection` resolved to
 * whatever that operand said, and a tupleset relation admitting a
 * userset had its subject relation discarded on dispatch, landing
 * on a different relation of the linked object and **granting**.
 *
 * **Hand-built models.** The single-operand intersection is not
 * expressible in the DSL — `define viewer: a and a` is accepted
 * upstream, because the transformer emits two children — so a
 * DSL-driven test would pass against an accepted model and prove
 * nothing. The rest are built the same way for consistency.

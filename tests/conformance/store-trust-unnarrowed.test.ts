/**
 * The clamp, tested where the conformance suite can see it.
 *
 * `userset-restrictions` pins the same model and the same rows and
 * passes with the clamp deleted, because it cannot reach it: the
 * adapter's SQL removes the inadmissible rows before the clamp is
 * asked about them, so at this layer the clamp is dead code. That
 * is the mechanism that hides the defect, not a mitigation for it —
 * replacing both `refsAdmit` calls in `clampToQuery` with `true`
 * leaves all 477 conformance tests green.
 *
 * `UnnarrowedStore` removes the SQL narrowing so the rows arrive.
 * The relation configs are unchanged, so `clampToQuery` still
 * clamps against the query **core** built rather than the one the
 * store saw, and it is then the only thing between an inadmissible
 * row and a grant. Every expectation below is therefore an
 * assertion about the clamp, and every one is compared against
 * OpenFGA rather than against tsfga's own prior behaviour.
 *
 * This suite exists to fail when the clamp is weakened. If it ever
 * passes with `refsAdmit` stubbed to `true`, it has stopped doing
 * its job.
 */

/**
 * Declines every narrowing the query offers. `null` is a store
 * saying "I did not narrow this", which is what the adapter's own
 * contract already means, so nothing here is a lie the adapter
 * could not tell on its own — a hand-written store that ignores
 * the ref lists behaves exactly like this.

/**
 * The condition is part of the type restriction, and OpenFGA
 * matches it exactly in both directions.
 *
 * A relation admitting `[user with weekday_only]` refuses a tuple
 * that carries no condition — *even when the check context would
 * have satisfied it* — and a relation admitting `[user]` refuses
 * one that carries a condition. Neither is intuitive from the
 * `directly_related_user_types` name, and getting the first
 * backwards grants where OpenFGA denies.
 *
 * Every row here mirrors a probe run against the container at
 * v1.18.2; `expectConformance` re-runs both sides on every
 * execution, so the table is checked rather than quoted.
 *
 * **Rows are pushed straight to the store**, as in
 * `userset-restrictions`. The write path enforces the same
 * restriction, so a fixture that wrote through `addTuple` could
 * only ever contain rows the narrow models admit — precisely the
 * rows that cannot exercise the read gate. OpenFGA reaches the
 * same state by writing under a wide model and narrowing after.

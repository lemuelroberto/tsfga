/**
 * A relation the model does not define, on both engines.
 *
 * Upstream answers HTTP 400 `validation_error`, `invalid relation:
 * relation 'document#reviewer' not found`, and it answers that
 * before it reads anything. tsfga read a missing relation config as
 * *unrestricted*: the write path refuses such a tuple, but a row
 * already in the store on that relation was narrowed against
 * nothing, admitted, and granted.
 *
 * **The row goes in through the store.** `addTuple` refuses exactly
 * this shape, so a fixture built on the write path could not
 * contain one. A row that outlives its config is how a real
 * deployment gets here — a deleted config, an out-of-band writer, a
 * partially applied fixture.
 *
 * The second half is the boundary the first half must not cross. A
 * tuple-to-userset may name a computed relation that only *some* of
 * the tupleset's admitted types define: upstream validates the
 * model when at least one of them does
 * (`isUsersetRewriteValid`) and then **skips** the rows whose type
 * does not (`produceTTUDispatches`). So an undefined relation
 * reached through a tupleset is a `false`, not a refusal, and a fix
 * that raised on every missing config would trade a fail-open for a
 * fail-closed. Probed on v1.18.2: `document:d1#viewer` answers
 * `false` there, with the model accepted.
